JavaScript Workshop using a Pacman Implementation
=====================================

Welcome! 
This is a repository that is supposed to be used as a teaching tool for javascript!
Each branch in this repo shows one problem in the code base which the students can fix interactively.
The goal is to teach basic concepts like variables, functions, for loops and if-statements interactively while also being fun (the end result is always a working pacman game).
We also provide presentation slides you can use as teaching material.
Slides for the introduction(for now they are still in german) can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q9fJFV1qtXJLxE2v2TH3edGnlfD2hmvqa_0ILhPj6kk/edit?usp=sharing) and [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fmqR0JnGWzjMxeG88iPnUuziESTq3_zuCdRXopszSX4/edit?usp=sharing)
